Starter code for HW0

To set up this project for editing in Eclipse, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your machine with the command:
```
git clone https://github.com/TrinityUniv-CS1321-Spring2017/homework0-username.git
```

2. Within Eclipse, right click in the Package Explorer panel on the left, and choose "New -> Scala Project"

3. Uncheck the box for "Use default location", then click the Browse... button after the Location text field. Navigate to the folder created by the clone command (homework0-username) select the folder and click on Open. This should case the Project name to automatically be called "homework0-username". Click on the "Next >" button (NOT the Finish button).

4. Click on the Libraries tab near the top of the pop up window. Click on "Add Library..." and then select "Scala Library". Click on "Next >" and then "Finish" and then "Finish" again.

At this point, you should have a project in Eclipse named "homework0-username" and within the src folder you should have a cs2.util package that contains the Complex.scala starter code.

Complete the methods and tester object within this file and save your work.

To turn in this assignment, you will need to use git commands from the command line. From a terminal window, first navigate to your project folder. This will be a folder within your workspace named homework0-username.  Once there, issue the following commands:
```
git add cs2/util/Complex.scala
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push
```

Lastly, go to your github.com page and verify that the files there are what you would like to submit.  If you need to make changes to your code, do so, and then issue the above three git commands again to commit your newest changes.
